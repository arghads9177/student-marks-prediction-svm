    "# Student Marks Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to predict the marks obtained by students based on their study time and the number of courses they have opted for. The dataset for this project has been downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of a small number of instances and attributes, making it both simple and challenging. Despite the limited number of features and samples, the goal is to build a regression model that captures the patterns in the data while ensuring generalizability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Properties of the Dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Number of Instances**: 100\n",
    "- **Number of Attributes**: 3 (including the target variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand the Dataset & Cleanup**: Explore and clean the dataset as necessary.\n",
    "2. **Build Regression Models**: Develop regression models to predict student marks based on study time and number of courses.\n",
    "3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics like R-squared (RÂ²), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), etc., and compare the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Source\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is available on Kaggle in the following link:\n",
    "> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/student-marks-dataset/data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **number_courses**: Numeric data. This is the Number of Courses Opted by the student.\n",
    "- **time_study**: Numeric data. This is the Average Time Studied per day by the student (in hours).\n",
    "- **Marks**: Marks obtained by the student (target variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Training**: The objective of model training is to train the model with the dataset so that it can predict the marks of student.\n",
    "2. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using different metrics like R2 Score, and find the loss or residual present in the model with Root Mean Squeared Error, Mean Squared Error and Mean Absolute Error.\n",
    "3. **Model Optimization**: The objective of model optimization is to find and optimal model for this dataset using Cross Validation and Hyperparameter Tuning to enhance the performance of the trained model and reduce the loss present in the model so that it can predict the marks of student accurately."

    "\n",
    "The model, with a 99% training score and a 98% testing score, is performing extremely well, showing both high accuracy and good generalization. The use of the RBF kernel, C = 5, and epsilon = 0.2 is creating a balanced SVR model that fits the data effectively without significant overfitting. However, itâs still advisable to validate the model further using cross-validation and test it on more diverse datasets to ensure its robustness."
