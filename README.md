# Student Marks Prediction - Regression Problem using XGBoost

## Description

This project aims to predict the marks obtained by students based on their study time and the number of courses they have opted for. The dataset for this project has been downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 

The dataset consists of a small number of instances and attributes, making it both simple and challenging. Despite the limited number of features and samples, the goal is to build a regression model that captures the patterns in the data while ensuring generalizability.

### Properties of the Dataset:
- **Number of Instances**: 100
- **Number of Attributes**: 3 (including the target variable)

### Objective:
1. **Understand the Dataset & Cleanup**: Explore and clean the dataset as necessary.
2. **Build Regression Models**: Develop regression models to predict student marks based on study time and number of courses.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics like R-squared (RÂ²), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), etc., and compare the results.

### Dataset Features:
- **number_courses**: Number of Courses Opted by the student.
- **time_study**: Average Time Studied per day by the student (in hours).
- **Marks**: Marks obtained by the student (target variable).

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset in CSV format.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, cleaning, model training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Saved regression models and related files.
